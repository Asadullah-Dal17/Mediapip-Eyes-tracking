# Eyes Tracking with Mediapipe python
> *Here we want to estimate the position of eyes using computer vision techniques, we will use simpler approaches which we have used first, but later on we will make that more advance, tracking the pupils with image processing techniques*


Why I am repeating same project :question:

Answer: the Dlib face detection and landmark detection, implementation is quite, hardhack, on the top of that, you have issue, of installation of dlib on windows machine, while mediapipe quite faster then dlib, implementation way more simpler, straight forward, so let's give it a short, 


## TODO 

- [x] *Face mesh*
- [x] *Landmark detection*
- [ ] *Eye:eye::eye: Extracting Landmarks only*
- [ ] *Eyes:eye::eye: Blinking Detector*
- [ ] *Extracting Eyes using Masking Techniques*
- [ ] *Estimating Position of Eyes :eye::eye:*
